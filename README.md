Codedemy is an online learning platform where any person will be able to build their own dream e-learning web courses and sell their own course online. Particularly this application is aiming to make academia more interesting. Money is always a hurdle in everyone's life and to cope up with this, idea of codedemy originated. 
For thousands of years, people have known that the best way to understand a concept is to explain it to someone else - “While we teach, we learn,”.
Students enlisted to tutor others, researchers have found, work harder to understand the material, recall it more accurately and apply it more effectively. In what scientists have dubbed “the protégé effect,” student teachers score higher on tests than pupils who are learning only for their own sake. But how can children, still learning themselves, teach others? One answer: by making online video content by just sitting in their room.
By teaching what you already know about your profession or hobby, you'll learn more, potentially gain some notoriety as an up-and-coming expert, make new connections with people, and find new opportunities. And you'll have some FUN. You don;'t need to be an expert in that thing ;).
